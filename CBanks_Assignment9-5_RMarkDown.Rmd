*  Introduction
 This assignment will work with S&P 500 data
 to calculate log returns and volatility measures 
 using 3 decay factors.
 Preparation Stage:
 -Set working directory
 -Load libraries
 -Get the S&P500 data
 install the tseries package
 load library xts from tseries
 install packages FPP and timeSeries via local CRAN

```{r} 
## Load the libraries
library(timeSeries)
library(zoo)
library(tseries)
library(xts)
library(fpp)
library(plyr) 
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(latticeExtra)
library(googleVis)
library(quantmod)
library(PerformanceAnalytics)

## Get the file and create data sets
xom <- get.hist.quote("XOM",quote=c("Close"))


## Assigned group was 11, dataset XOM (Exxon)
xomdata <- get.hist.quote("XOM",quote=c("Close"))

## Determine # of objects
length(xomdata)

## Note the start of period
head(xomdata)  

## Note the end of period
tail(xomdata)

## Get plot of data
plot(xomdata)


## Get the log returns
xomret <- log(lag(xomdata)) - log(xomdata)
head(xomret)
tail(xomret)

## Look at the volatility measure
xomvol <- sd(xomret) * sqrt(250) * 100
xomvol

####################################
## Get volatility measures with a
## Continuous Loopback window
get
Vol <- function(d, logrets)
{

	var = 0

	lam = 0

	varlist <- c()

	for (r in logrets) {

		lam = lam*(1 - 1/d) + 1
	
	var = (1 - 1/lam)*var + (1/lam)*r^2

		varlist <- c(varlist, var)

	}

	sqrt(varlist)
}


##  Use 3 different decay factors

volest <- Vol(10,xomret)

volest2 <- Vol(30,xomret)

volest3 <- Vol(100,xomret)

plot(volest,type="l")

lines(volest2,type="l",col="red")

lines(volest3, type = "l", col="blue")

##  Analysis - Discussion
##  The stock is Exxon, and the first plot of
##  data shows the stock activity to date
##  Interesting is the volatility index which has
##  an instance of a wide peak and an instance of 
##  a trough, which stock watchers would view as
##  stability concern.  Overall, the stock has
##  performed consistently, and the actual merger
##  of Exxon and Mobil has kept the stock alive
##  in the wake of recent reductions in price of oil
##  per barrel.
